# Portfolio

## 1. [Breast Cancer](https://github.com/Evorizher/Portfolio/tree/master/Breast%20Cancer) 

---

Training and hyperparameter tuning classification models to classify whether the cell are malignant or benign. Data from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data. 

## 2. [CIFAR-10 Classification](https://github.com/Evorizher/Portfolio/tree/master/CIFAR-10%20Classification) 

---

Build Convolutional Neural Network to classify object in images to 10 classes by building the neural network layer by layer and see the performance. 

## 3. [Final Project](https://github.com/Evorizher/Portfolio/tree/master/Final%20Project) 

---

Final project as an undergraduate Mathematics student in ITB: simulate how zk-SNARK work. Zk-SNARK simply put is how A can prove that A has an information and A wants to prove B that A knows that information without revealing what the information is, the only information that is known is whether the statement "A knows information" is true or not. 

## 4. [Math Students](https://github.com/Evorizher/Portfolio/tree/master/Math%20Students) 

---

Analysis of math students scores. Using statistical tests to see what factors affects math students' scores. 

## 5. [Object Detection](https://github.com/Evorizher/Portfolio/tree/master/Object%20Detection) 

---

Fine-tuning MobileNetV2 to perform classification and localization on images of dogs and cats.
