1. Breast Cancer

Training and hyperparameter tuning classification models to classify whether the cell are malignant or benign. Data from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data.

2. CIFAR-10 Classification

Build Convolutional Neural Network to classify object in images to 10 classes by building the neural network layer by layer and see the performance.

3. Final Project

Final project as an undergraduate Mathematics student in ITB: simulate how zk-SNARK work. Zk-SNARK simply put is how A can prove that A has an information and A wants to prove B that A knows that information without revealing what the information is, the only information that is known is whether the statement "A knows information" is true or not.

4. Math Students

Analysis of math students scores. Using statistical tests to see what factors affects math students' scores.

5. Object Detection

Fine-tuning MobileNetV2 to perform classification and localization on images of dogs and cats.
